# p24_agenda

üë©‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è This project is basically an online agenda for doctor. The goal is to avoid loosing time booking appointments by phone for example.<br/>
The doctor can create an account and specify his informations, the days and the time slots he wants to work every week. <br/>
Then, he can create his own list of patients, allowing them to to book an appointment online under strict conditions:<br/>
-They cannot book an appointment when the doctor blocked it.<br/>
-They cannot book an appointment in a forbidden day, decided by the doctor when he created the patient account.<br/>
Indeed, the doctor can be free to create type of appointment and decide to have them just on Monday for example.
Other than that, the patient is free to choose any slot showed to him. This way, the doctor has just to setup his patient list and the patient books them online. <br/>
<br/><br/>
üè• This way, the patient feels more concerned about his appointment timing, and it is less likely for him to forget it. Of course, some notifications will be personalized by the doctor.

# üìÜ Voici un exemple en vid√©o de l'√©tat du projet ! 
Here is the main page of the doctor, he can book appointment himself, delete appointlent (sending a mail to the patient, block a time slot to block the patient booking at that time and free a time sloot allowing the patient to book. <br/>
